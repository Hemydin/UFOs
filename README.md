# UFOs
### Project Overview
Using JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, we built and styled a dynamic webpage that showcases different UFO sightings across the United States. The webpage presents the data as both visually appealing and interactive. It allows using filters that let users refine their search based on multiple criteria.

### Results
The webpage allows a person to search for UFO sightings by filtering on date, city, state, country, and shape. The table displays results according to user input (changes in the filters). For example, if I were to search for any UFO sightings in my home state, TN, the table displays one result.

### Summary
The webpage we created presents the information in a clear and polished format; however, there are always ways for improvement. 

1. Having five different filter search boxes makes it difficult to understand how to use them. We can add a "clear" button in the search bar to clear out any filters. Currently, only clicking on "UFO sightings" at the top left corner resets the table back to normal. 
2. We can include a dropdown list to allow the user to select a choice within the menu.
